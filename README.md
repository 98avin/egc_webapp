# Meeting Manager for Rutgers Engineering Governing Council
Simple web-app usable by organizations to facilitate and track attendance, and hold polls. Members can log-in with their school email and vote all from the mobile optimized website at egc-webapp.firebaseapp.com

To run locally:
1. Create a new file called *config.json* in the src folder under the root directory. Populate it as follows:
```
export default {
  apiKey: "",
  authDomain: "",
  databaseURL: "",
  projectId: "",
  storageBucket: "",
  messagingSenderId: "",
  appId: ""
}
```
 To obtain the config object you will need to set-up a firebase project and initialize an app under that project.
 See here for more info: https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?hl=en
 Follow the directions for *Obtain config object for your web-app*

2. Modify the *index.html* file in the public folder under the root directory to include your google API key in line 3:
```
  <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?&v=3.exp&libraries=geometry,drawing,places&key={YOUR API KEY HERE (remove brackets)}"></script>
```

3. Open the root directory in Terminal, and run *npm install*
4. Run *npm start*, and new browser window should open with the app running.

COMING SOON:
1. How to set-up the database from scratch (structure)
2. How to modify the app to run with different schools
3. How to deal with dependency issues (a little messy currently)

Other TO-DO:
1. Rework all React components to proper usage (big optimization potential)
2. Migrate from Firebase Real-time Database to Cloud Firestore (more reliability speed), or move the whole thing to AWS
